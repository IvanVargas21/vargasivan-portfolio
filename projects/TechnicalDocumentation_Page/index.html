          <h3>What is Responsive Web Design?</h3>
          <p>
            Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web development that
            ensures websites provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide
            range of devices and screen sizes, from desktop computers to
            smartphones and tablets. The goal is to create web pages that adapt
            to the user's environment, providing a seamless and user-friendly
            experience regardless of the device being used.
          </p>
          <p id="rwd-p">Key Principles of Responsive Web Design:</p>
          <ol id="rwd-key-principles">
            <li class="rwd_principle">Fluid Grids:</li>
            <p>
              In responsive design, layouts are built using fluid grids, where
              elements are sized relative to the screen or parent container,
              often using percentages rather than fixed units like pixels. This
              allows the layout to adjust and reflow as the screen size changes.
            </p>
            <li class="rwd_principle">Flexible Images:</li>
            <p>
              Images and media in a responsive web design are also made
              flexible, ensuring they resize within their containing elements or
              viewport. This prevents images from overflowing or being too small
              on various devices.
            </p>
            <li class="rwd_principle">Media Queries:</li>
            <p>
              Media queries are a fundamental tool in responsive design,
              allowing developers to apply different styles based on the
              characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, or
              resolution. This enables the design to adapt at specific
              breakpoints, ensuring the content looks good on all devices.
            </p>
            <li class="rwd_principle">Mobile-First Design:</li>
            <p>
              A mobile-first approach involves designing for the smallest screen
              sizes first, then progressively enhancing the design for larger
              screens. This approach helps ensure that essential content is
              accessible on all devices, with additional features and styles
              added for larger screens.

        <article>
          <h3>What is The Viewport?</h3>
          <p>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.</p>
          <p>
            The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile
            phone than on a computer screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for
            computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static
            design and a fixed size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile
            phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To
            fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page
            to fit the screen.
          </p>

        <h3>What is Grid-View?</h3>
        <p>
          Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is
          divided into columns:
        </p>
        <div class="grid-container" id="grid1">
          <div class="grid-column"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Using a grid-view is very helpful when designing web pages. It makes
          it easier to place elementss on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of
          100%, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window.
        </p>
        <div class="grid-container" id="grid2">
          <div class="grid-column">
            <div id="horizontal-top"></div>
            <div id="broken-box-left"></div>
            <div id="box-right"></div>

        <h3>What is a Media Query?</h3>
        <p>Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.</p>
        <p>
          It uses the <span>@media</span> rule to include a block of CSS
          properties only if a certain condition is true.
        </p>
        <div class="example-container">
          <p class="examples">Example:</p>
          <p>
            If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will
            be lightblue:
          </p>
          <!--
                    The <code> tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
                    -->
          <code>
            @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {<br />
            body{ background-color: lightblue; <br />
            } <br />
            }
          </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Images">
        <header>Images</header>
        <h3>Using The width Property</h3>
        <p>
          If the width property is set to a percentage and the height property
          is set to "auto", the image will be responsive and scale up and down:
        </p>
        <p class="examples">Example:</p>
        <div class="example-container">
          <code>
            img { <br />
            width: 100%;<br />
            height: auto;<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be
            larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases,
            will be to use the <span>max-width</span> property instead.
          </p>

          <h3>Using The max-width Property</h3>
          <p>
            If the <span>max-width</span> property is set to 100%, the image
            will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than
            its original size:
          </p>
          <p class="Example">Example:</p>
          <code>
            img { <br />
            max-width: 100%;<br />
            height: auto;<br />
            }

        <h3>Using The width Property</h3>
        <p>
          If the <span>width</span> property is set to 100%, the video player
          will be responsive and scale up and down:
        </p>
        <div class="example-container">
          <p>Example:</p>
          <code>
            video { <br />
            width: 100%;<br />
            height: auto;<br />
            }
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          Notice that in the example above, the video player can be scaled up to
          be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases,

        <p>
          If the <span>max-width</span> property is set to 100%, the video
          player will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger

        <div class="example-container">

        <h3>What is Framework?</h3>
        <p>
          CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that simplify and streamline
          the process of creating websites with CSS. These frameworks provide a
          foundation of pre-written CSS and, often, JavaScript, to help
          developers quickly build responsive and aesthetically pleasing
          websites. By using a CSS framework, developers can avoid writing
          common styles from scratch, saving time and ensuring consistency
          across web projects.
        </p>
        <p>Example of a Popular CSS Framework: <strong>Bootstrap</strong></p>
        <p>
          Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks. It was originally
          developed by Twitter and is widely used for creating responsive and
          mobile-first websites. Bootstrap includes a wide array of components
          and utilities, making it easier to build complex layouts and
          interactive elements.
